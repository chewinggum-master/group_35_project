You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message

生成的 FIPO 指令:
To effectively solve math word problems, follow these steps:
1. Carefully read and understand the problem to identify the key information and the type of operation required.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts, if necessary, to simplify the process.
3. Perform the necessary calculations, either mentally or using a calculator, and write down each step.
4. Double-check your work to ensure accuracy and correct any errors.
5. Present the final numeric answer clearly and concisely, along with any relevant units or measurements.
By following these steps, you will be able to solve math word problems effectively and accurately.
