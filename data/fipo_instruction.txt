To improve the instruction for solving math word problems, consider the following revised version:

1. Carefully read and understand the given math word problem to identify the key information, such as the problem context, the given numbers, and the required operation.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts to simplify the process. This may involve identifying the units of measurement, recognizing patterns, or simplifying expressions.
3. Apply the appropriate mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to solve the problem. Be sure to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) to ensure accuracy.
4. Check your work by double-checking your calculations and ensuring that your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
5. Clearly and concisely communicate the final numeric answer, along with any relevant units of measurement or significant figures, to accurately represent the solution to the problem.

By following these steps, you can effectively solve math word problems and provide clear, accurate answers.
